# Say hi to zai

**Zai** is a Q&A retrieval augmented generation (RAG) application for question and answer (Q&A) with a large language model (LLM). Zai uses only completely free and open source technologies that can be installed on any computer without any restrictions.

Currently, Zai is using Meta's Llama 3.2 running on Ollama with `nomic-embed-text` embedding model.

Right now there is no publicly available endpoint for Zai, but a [Q&A session transcript](q%26a.md) is available for inspection.
